# Cycle One Prototype

The goal of the first prototype is to focus on how OSS projects interested in
oscoin will be able to explore and interact with the network. We are limiting
the scope to one type of user, meaning we're looking at the different intents
that user type might have and how they then will interact with the network. We
will have time exploring other types of users and advanced interactions in
later iterations.

## Run

It is advised to use [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) for
development, which can be used as such:

```
elm-live src/Main.elm --pushstate -- --debug
```
