# Rationale

To evaluate if TypeScript is a good option for our frontend needs, we decided
to write a small SPA. This SPA will consist of:

- a screen with a single button, which when clicked, launches a wizard
- the wizard opens as a modal and implements the ["new proposal" feature][0]


# Setup

```
yarn create react-app experiment-typescript --typescript
```

## NeoVim
```
Plug 'HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim'
Plug 'mhartington/nvim-typescript', { 'do': './install.sh' }

:PlugInstall
:UpdateRemotePlugins
```

# Observations

- create-react-app has built-in support for TS
- compiles to clean JS
- Jest is [converting to TS][3] (good sign for industry adoption)
