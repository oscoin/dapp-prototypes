# Rationale

To evaluate if clojurescript is a good option for our frontend needs,
we decided to write a small SPA. This SPA will consist of:

- a screen with a single button, which when clicked, launches a wizard
- the wizard opens as a modal and implements the ["new proposal" feature][0]


# Setup
Install [Leiningen][1].

```
lein new figwheel experiment-clojurescript -- --reagent
```

Following [this][2] tutorial.

```
cd experiment-clojurescript
lein figwheel                     # launch "watchman"
```

Open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.


# Observations

- entry-point for documentation was confusing, shadow-cljs GitHub project page
  turned out to be the definitive source

- output JS kinda ugly, but according to Jelle can be switched to something
  more [readable][3]


# Outcome

Xla and I decided to stop looking at CLJS because most team members strongly
gravitate towards pure JS + Typescript + React, besides cloudhead dislikes CLJS.
